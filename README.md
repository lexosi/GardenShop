# Garden Shop App

This app is a group project based on an exercise which is part of the specialised Java Back-end programming course at the ITAcademy school (Barcelona).

The program has to manage the product stock of a garden shop. The first level of the app must manage the persistence in a TXT file. 
You can see the details of the project requirements at Requirements.pdf file. 

## Our Project
Our application has three main functions. First, it serves as a stock manager for the registered garden shop. Second, it manages a purchase with multiple products while creating an invoice at the same time. And at last, it has different menu options to display concrete information about the shop on screen.


### Some of the challenges we faced and features we hope to implement in the future

Our project has been undergoing a chain of unpredictable personal setbacks which it have made really difficult to make it to the project deliver date.<br> 
Our first approach was to make this program with a combination of Domain-Driven Design and Hexagonal Architecture, so we can attain all three levels of persistence (Txt, MySql, MongoDB) using the same project.<br> 
Unfortunately, in the middle of our setbacks, we also became short-staffed. As the remaining members were still optimistic we kept working fearless with the same approach. Well, lesson learned! Life has show us that sometimes we need to put aside for a moment our idealistic approaches to being practical and to deliver the project when its needed. <br> 
So we have finally decided to use a simple Java inheritance structure to develop the application. Perhaps, if we had let go a little before we could had been delivered on time the three levels of persistence using this simple structure.<br> 
After investing so many hours in the previous project we don’t feel that our efforts were down the drain. We have gained a lot of knowledge even if the project wasn’t finished.<br> 
<br> 
In the future we hope to deliver the project using DDD and Hexagonal Architecture, reaching the three levels of persistence.Still in talks to add spring to the combination. Hope our mentors keep giving us their feedback on it.

## How to Use the Project
Clone the repository to your local machine
```java Cloning repo
git clone https://github.com/lexosi/GardenShop.git
```
Then execute the application on your preferred Java IDE. Application was created in Eclipse IDE.

The first screen of the project is to created the garden shop and then you enter in the menu with all the options to manage the stock and to screen information about the shop elements.
